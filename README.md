# -Model-Validation-and-Risk-Assessment

Project: Credit Risk Model Validation
Description: Build a logistic regression model to predict loan defaults using publicly available datasets like those from Kaggle or OpenML.
Tasks to Include:
Assess the model's performance using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
Perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in input variables impact predictions.
Test for model stability over time by simulating data drift and checking the impact on model predictions.
Document and present the process of model validation and risk assessment.
Skills Demonstrated: Model evaluation, risk management, regulatory compliance (e.g., SR 11-7).

Model Validation and Risk Assessment for Credit Risk Prediction
Overview
This project demonstrates the development and validation of a credit risk prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan, ensuring the model is robust through extensive validation and risk assessment.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Binary classification model to predict credit risk.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation using ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
Model Validation: Cross-validation and sensitivity analysis for threshold adjustments.
Risk Assessment: Analysis of feature importance and risk factors associated with credit decisions.
