# -Model-Validation-and-Risk-Assessment

Project: Credit Risk Model Validation
Description: Build a logistic regression model to predict loan defaults using publicly available datasets like those from Kaggle or OpenML.
Tasks to Include:
Assess the model's performance using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
Perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in input variables impact predictions.
Test for model stability over time by simulating data drift and checking the impact on model predictions.
Document and present the process of model validation and risk assessment.
Skills Demonstrated: Model evaluation, risk management, regulatory compliance (e.g., SR 11-7).
